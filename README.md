# React Finance App with Redux

Simple Finance Manager app built with React and Redux

Try it out at: https://felipegalvao.github.io/react-finance-redux/public/index.html

This is a React app to manage expenses and incomes. You need to login with Google 
or Github to use it. When logged in, you can add items (expenses or incomes), 
filter items by date or text and clear the filters. You can also delete 
expenses and incomes. Authentication and persistence of expenses and incomes 
is handled with Firebase. 

Tests with Karma and Expect.

I also built the same app built without Redux, in the following URL: https://github.com/felipegalvao/react-finance-redux
